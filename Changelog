version 3.3.0
- For reflection annotations, it is supported to specify the class and class name
- Support hook and backup limited effective app versions
- Add the option targetClassExec to set whether the target class compiles other methods
- Refactor the code related to the hook instruction

version 3.2.0
 - Rename the annotations related to the execution mode
 - add triggerFieldName for more precise control over hook
 - Optimize object-to-string conversion, add length limits
 - The instance method 'this' may be empty. Optimize the acquisition of parameters and add exceptions to check if the' this' parameter exists
 - arm and arm64 native hook optimization. The very short jit code of arm32 hook will not cause errors. arm64 supports shorter hook instructions and cannot locate the jumped so

version 3.1.0
 - Expand the search scope to support finding methods and field references from BootClass
 - Optimize the speed of search
 - Adding an interface implementation for traversing classes is very practical for traversing classes from bootclassLoader
 - The callback index for field and method search is changed to dexpc, which can be used for hook instructions

version 3.0.0
 - dump smail instruction will print out the relevant register contents
 - Support specifying classes to search for objects from the heap
 - Implement obtain all callers of the target method
 - Optimize for extremely short function hooks

version 2.2.0
 - Unhook support.

version 2.1.0
 - Support inheriting from the parent class or interface of the hooked class
 - Anti detection enhanced

version 2.0.2
 - Optimize rpc calls and support methods for binding other objects.
 - Add some very practical methods.

version 2.0.1
 - Rpc server Optimization.

version 2.0.0
 - Supports method hook call chains, allowing one method to be hooked by multiple methods.
 - When initializing  through loadLibrary, it supports passing initialization flags.

version 1.1.3
 - Fix the crash issue on some android12 devices.
 - Add instance method argument count check.

version 1.1.2
- Fix the issue of GC triggering deadlocks during JIT compilation.

version 1.1.1
 - Optimize the hook logic and remove the abnormal features of rwx from the so library being hooked.
 - The rpc client adds support for java.
 - Add decompilation of the smali code.


version 1.1.0
 - Optimize jit compilation to avoid inconsistencies, code recycling and other issues caused by concurrency.

version 1.0.9
 - Optimize the code logic of the hook instruction to achieve better compatibility. Compatible with lineageOs.
 - jit compilation adds locks to prevent concurrency from causing jit code to be overwritten.

version 1.0.8
 - Fixed the issue left over from v1.0.5 where code execution listening was triggered only when the method was running.

version 1.0.7
 - Support direct loading of the so library for initialization.
 - Methods can be obtained through annotation aliases, ensuring that they can still be obtained even in the event of confusion.
 - Add proguard obfuscation rules.

version 1.0.6
 - Optimized the matching of primitive types.
 - Fix the issue where the system class instruction hook does not take effect.

version 1.0.5
 - Improve the execution speed of the instruction hook by only listening when the target method is executing.
 - Hooker is not necessarily an image class, it can be the target class itself.
 - Primitive types can also be fuzzy matched.
 - Can search for a method by its name. Support commenting aliases for methods, so that even after confusion, the target method can still be found.
 - Support multiple backups of a method and define the call way for the backup method.

version 1.0.4
 - Throw an exception when the target class is an interface.
 - Improve the methods related to the instruction hook.
 - Transaction optimization and entrypoint judgment of arm methods.

version 1.0.3
 - Supports hooking of instructions.

version 1.0.2
 - Support backing up the fields of the parent class and setting possible aliases for the fields.
 - The specific type of a field can be determined by passing objects.
 - Support setting the effective Android system scope.
 - Prioritize using AOT code.

version 1.0.1
 - Prohibit any instance methods, even if there are unrecognized annotations.
 - Multiple identical backup methods are not allowed.
 - In addition to disable the logging function, it now supports replacing the logging function.
version 1.0.0:
 - Initial version.
